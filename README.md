# Excel Dashboard – Bike Sales Analysis

## Overview

This Excel project analyses a dataset containing customer demographics and their bike purchase behaviour. The goal was to create an interactive dashboard that reveals patterns in who buys bikes and why. The workflow included data cleaning, pivot table creation, visualisations, and dashboard design with slicers.

## Dataset Fields
